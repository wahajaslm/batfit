Output ONLY one JSON object with keys `context` and `interaction`. Follow `policy/context_schema.yaml` ordering: start `context` with target_weight fields, then profile/pickup, then situational fields. Normalize units yourself: convert any gram/kg inputs to pounds (also include `target_weight_g` when available). Normalize budgets to USD—whenever a user mentions price, output `"budget":{"amount":<usd>,"currency":"USD"}` using reasonable FX assumptions. `interaction` must include `asked` (ordered list of prompts you actually asked), `skipped` (fields the user declined), and `why_next_question` (string reason or null). Never mention edges, spine, grade, accessories, or chat prose; respond with that single JSON only.
